## Development Process
We chose the *fork and pull model* ([read more](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-collaborative-development-models)). Contributors are invited to push new changes to their forked repository (preferably creating topic branches). Pull requests are later required to be raised for these changes <a href="https://github.com/dhruvshettty/homely-surveillance/pulls">here</a> for code review and general discussions, and after review, these can be merged into the main repository.
